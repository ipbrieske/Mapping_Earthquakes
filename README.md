# Mapping_Earthquakes
Visualizing tectonic activity around the globe


## Overview
This project utilized Leaflet and Mapbox to visualize data on earthquakes around the world. Using D3, our Javascript files are able to pull GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey's websites to keep all information constantly up to date. A config.js file will be needed with an API_KEY from Mapbox in order to function. The page features multiple viewing windows and map backgrounds, including satellite views, a dark mode map, and a highlight of the borders of global tectonic plates.
